This is repository of some random bot for Discord which was created just for fun and for some educational purposes *(Made with Discord.py library)*

> **NOTE!** Due to an accidental error with experiments on the GPG key, it has been removed and past commits with it are marked as "Unverified". These commits remain safe, but due to the fact that my decision to stop signing was made later, only the last commits (after dev-2.1.0) no longer have these labels ðŸ¤·

## How to use this bot

0. Install necessary tools *(Python, Any IDE or Code Editor, etc.)*
1. Clone this repository *(If you want to clone with Webhook-Notifier, use* `git clone --recurse-submodules`*)*
2. Create a Discord Bot on [Discord Developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications) page
3. Go to `Bot` section to grab a token of your bot and enable all `Privileged Gateway Intents`
4. Run `python bot_panel.py` in a main directory and set up your bot
5. Run `python main.py` to run bot
6. After getting a log that bot was logged in, you are good to go

> If you didn't install the missing dependencies when configuring the bot, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in main directory
>
> *(If you are experiencing installation problems, and your pip isn't updated to the latest version, use `--use-feature=2020-resolver` flag)*
