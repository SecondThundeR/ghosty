Initially, this project was created at one time as entertainment and some kind of attempt to teach Python. Subsequently, he evolved into something more than I initially saw him in my thoughts.

However, due to the fact that only my friends used this bot and it worked on one server, I decided to abandon it and archive it.

Porting to JavaScript not only turned out to be terrible in terms of time and effort, but also impractical, since due to changes in the Discord API, we had to revise the logic of the commands themselves, which worked differently due to Slash commands.

This project helped me a lot in my development as a Python developer and as I developed new functions and logic, I learned more and more about this interesting language.

However, sometimes you have to close your creations, which will remain here as a memory of the good times.

Perhaps, after this message, I will do something worthwhile and grandiose, but who knows :)
